# Extracurricular Economics
Throughout my undergraduate career at [Northeastern University (NEU)](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/economics/), I was deeply involved with the Economics Society and its various branches. I found this to be a fantastic way to engage with other students who had similar interests, expand my breadth of knowledge without the pressure of classes and engage with opportunities that otherwise wouldn't have been available to me.

NEU had a wonderful variety of organizations available for students to interact with. 
1. **Econ Society**, a social club with weekly meetings consisting of; Research Presentations, Simulations or Internship Panels.
2. **ECONPress**, a full-flegded journal registered with the Library of Congress that strictly accepts undergraduate research papers.
3. **Fed Challenge Team**, named for the annual Fed Challenge, this arm of the organization handled all external competitions; iOme, UpToUs, Fiscal Challenge, etc. 
4. **Citizen Schools Collaboration**, a ten session curriculum of 90 minute classes designed for middle schoolers and high schoolers to introduce them to the field of economics.

Some of my favorite Econ Society Activities were simulations. These required the e-board to put in a lot of work up front, but the social nature and amusement of the members made it all worth it.

I still have the materials for all of the above activities at my disposal if you are interested in learning more. 

If you are an undergraduate student interested in setting up an Economics Society or similar club at your institution, please reach out to me. I'd be more than happy to talk with you about my own experiences and how to achieve what you're setting out to do. 
General thoughts on running an undergraduate extracurricular econ program. 
+ Your goal is to ensure every student can engage as much as they would like to. No student can or will want to do everything, but if there's a student interested in doing more than you are providing, you need to rise to that challenge.
+ Set up different arms of the organization as separate clubs. This will make financials easier but also open up opportunities for increased funding from your university.
+ It's important to keep de-facto operations integrated even if your different arms are de-jure separate in the eyes of your university. This looks like ensuring that each club meets at a separate time.
+ Faculty are busy. While schools with established organizations are likely to have entrenched faculty support, if you're just getting started or trying to expand the network though, you will need to reduce the load on your faculty advisors.
+ Starting an umbrella of organizations, or even a single organization will feel a bit like a startup. Enjoy making it your own, but never forget that others will need to take up the mantle after you graduate so things need to be documented clearly, concisely and correctly.
