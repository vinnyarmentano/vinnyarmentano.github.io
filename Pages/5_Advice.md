# Discovering Your Interests
Even if you're an economics major, your program will not likely introduce you to every branch of econ available. The main content of your micro & macro classes will be important to different sub-fields, but the applications may be radically different. If you find yourself bored with the applications you've been shown, it may behoove you to look beyond your university currciulum for inspiration. I discovered a series of online courses that solidified my interest in development economics. There are similar coureses available online for other subfields like; Game Theory, Health Economics, International Trade, Energy. These classes are niche, and likely more specialized than the electives your university offers. Of course, they don't count for much on your resume, but they are hard examples of the soft idea that you are passionate about the topic you selected.
If you're interested in development economics from the perspective of applied microeconomics, here are some courses you can pursue;
1. [JPAL 101x, Evaluating Social Programs](https://www.edx.org/course/evaluating-social-programs-mitx-jpal101x-0)
2. [JPAL 102x, Running Randomized Evaluations](https://www.edx.org/course/designing-and-running-randomized-evaluations)
3. [JPAL 350x, Measuring Health Outcomes in Field Surveys](https://www.edx.org/course/measuring-health-outcomes-in-field-surveys)
4. [MITx 14.73x, The Challenges of Global Poverty](https://www.edx.org/course/the-challenges-of-global-poverty)
5. [MITx 14.74x, Foundations of Development Policy](https://www.edx.org/course/foundations-of-development-policy)
6. [MITx 14.75x, Political Economy and Economic Development](https://www.edx.org/course/political-economy-and-economic-development)

If you're interested in Graduate School, here are some blogs from famous faculty.
+ [Chris Blattman, How to get a PhD \*and\* save the world](https://chrisblattman.com/2007/12/12/how-to-get-a-phd-and-save-the-world/)
+ [Greg Mankiw, Advice for Aspiring Economists](https://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2006/05/advice-for-aspiring-economists.html)

Some of the blogs are old but these criteria remain;
+ GRE Score in the 90th+ percentile
+ 3 Letters of Recommendation, at least 2 from faculty you've done research with
+ An A in Real Analysis. Some people will tell you that you should take it with the Rudin Textbook, but if it'll be your first time going through the material, don't. An A in an easier version of the course looks better than a B in the more difficult version.
