# Research Interests
While my main focus at the moment is classes, I plan to study agriculutural development from the perspective of applied microeconomics. I feel very fortunate that my own interests aligned well with the projects I was tasked with as an RA.
I believe strongly in the power of new technologies that will allow researchers to reduce measurement error. To that end, I also believe that Machine Learning can improve economics research signficantly, by improving data quality and opening up new data sources.
